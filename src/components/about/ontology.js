  			Protein Kinase Ontology (ProKinO) is a collaborative effort between the Evolutionary Systems
                        Biology Group Lab of Dr. Natarajan Kannan at the Biochemistry and Molecular
                        Biology Department and Dr. Krys J. Kochut's lab at the School of Computing,
                        both at University of Georgia, Athens, USA.  Gurinder Gosal, formerly Computer Science,
                        UGA, created the initial version of the software system to automatically populate 
			ProKinO from the selected data sources (see Data sources, below).  The population system has
                        been subsequently enhanced by Dr. Shima Dastgheib, formerly Computer Science, UGA, 
                        Dr. Daniel McSkimming, formerly IOB, UGA, and Dr. Abbas Keshavarzi, formerly Computer Science, UGA,
			and several other current and former lab members (see People, below).</p>

                        The conceptual representation of such diverse information in one place
                        enables not only rapid discovery of significant information related to
                        a specific protein kinase, but also enables large scale integrative
                        analysis of the protein kinase family.  An outline of the data organization in ProKinO is shown
			using a UML class diagram (see Schema, below).</p>
