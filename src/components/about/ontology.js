                        You can use this ontology browser to quickly query, navigate, and explore the knowledge graph including the sequence, structure, function, disease, pathway, and ligand information on kinases.
                        The conceptual representation of such diverse information in one place
                        enables not only rapid discovery of significant information related to
                        a specific protein kinase, but also enables  large scale integrative
                        analysis of the protein kinase family.

                        ProKinO is a collaborative effort between the Evolutionary Systems
                        Biology Group Lab of Dr. Natarajan Kannan at the Biochemistry and Molecular
                        Biology Department and Dr. Krys J. Kochut's lab at the Computer Science Department,
                        both at University of Georgia, Athens, USA.  Gurinder Gosal, Computer Science,
                        UGA, created the software system to automatically populate ProKinO from the
                        selected data sources.  The population system has
                        been enhanced by Shima Dastgheib, Computer Science, UGA and Daniel McSkimming,
                        IOB, UGA.  Currently, the population system is maintained and enhanced by
                        Abbas Keshavarzi, Computer Science, UGA.</p>
