This repo contains the `dev` version (untested and not stable) of the ProKinO browser's front-end source code ([view online](https://prokino.netlify.app)). The University of Georgia hosts the main version at [https://prokino.uga.edu](https://prokino.uga.edu).

#### Ontology

The Protein Kinase Ontology (ProKinO), is a protein kinase-specific ontology, which provides a controlled vocabulary of terms, their hierarchy, and relationships unifying sequence, structure, function, mutation and pathway information on kinases. The conceptual representation of such diverse information in one place enables not only rapid discovery of significant information related to a specific protein kinase, but also enables large scale integrative analysis of the protein kinase family.
